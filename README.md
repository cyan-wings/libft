In 42, it is forbidden to use any pre-defined funtions unless stated in the requirements. As such, students are tasked to create their own library functions as their 1st project before moving on to moderately difficult and advanced projects.

TODOs:
1. Error management for the functions.
2. Update ft_free_ft_split and ft_clear to reuse new memdel functions.
3. Makefile for each subfolder.
