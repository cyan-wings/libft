In 42, it is forbidden to use any pre-defined funtions unless stated in the requirements. As such, students are tasked to create their own library functions as their 1st project before moving on to moderately difficult and advanced projects.

TODOs:
1. Error management for the functions.
2. Makefile for each subfolder.
3. Consider separating quaternion functions from math lib.
4. Refactor ft_error_utils t_error struct to not clash with ft_printf.
5. Add protection to defines in ft_printf.h.
6. Refactor BUFFER_SIZE clash between get_next_line.h and ft_printf.h.
7. Refactor ft_split to use ft_strtok.
